      The restaurant management software ecosystem is complex and getting more
      so every year. There are scores of technologies that simplify and solve
      challenges that restaurants face. You’ve got products for the entire
      spectrum of restaurant operations. Then there’s the whole universe of
      restaurant analytics. It seems that the need to simplify is spawning more
      complexities. Digging deeper into the downside Research suggests that
      restaurant owners see the need for technology to simplify operations. But
      they are also jittery about the complexities it brings to the guest’s
      experience. Very often, effective use of these technologies requires
      complex integrations. And interruptions to the guest’s experience.
      Especially when you have products that don’t talk to each other. Imagine
      going to a restaurant to spend some peaceful time only to be hijacked by a
      screen or a form. Also, having individual technologies across the entire
      restaurant technology stack can be expensive. Not only money but the time
      it takes to make all the parts function together. This is key when you get
      your major sales on a few days in a week. No one wants to be grappling
      with technology instead of serving guests. And flipping tables.
